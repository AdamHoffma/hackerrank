#at minimum length of string
#create two pointer
#move the first pointer until you find a letter that matches the second pointer
#break that into a substring

#In the substring use two pointers
#One at the first index
#One at last index
#Move forward and backward simultaneously 
#Move until they dont match

String = 10

N = length of string
answer = 0

range of 19?
left = 9
