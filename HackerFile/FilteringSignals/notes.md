# We have integers coming through
# We have a set of parameters that only allow certain integers through
# We need the highest number P[0] and the lowest number for P[1]
# Inbetween those two integers and including them is the integers that come through
# We return an integer (count) of how many integer come through

# Init a counter
# Loop through the 2D array and get max value(p[0]) and store in object?
# Loop through the 2d array and get min value(p1) and store in object?
# Loop through integer coming in and if >= p[0] and <= p[1] count +=1


If J is equal to or higher then the low value and equal to or lower then the high value
